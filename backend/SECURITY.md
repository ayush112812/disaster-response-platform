# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the Disaster Response Platform.

## Environment Variables

- [ ] **Never** commit `.env` files to version control
- [ ] Use different secrets for development, staging, and production
- [ ] Rotate API keys and secrets periodically
- [ ] Use environment-specific configuration files (`.env.development`, `.env.production`)

## API Security

- [ ] Enable CORS with specific allowed origins
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set secure and httpOnly flags on cookies
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Use Helmet.js for setting secure HTTP headers

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Use strong, randomly generated JWT secrets
- [ ] Set appropriate token expiration times
- [ ] Implement refresh tokens with secure storage
- [ ] Enforce strong password policies
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Use OAuth for third-party authentication when possible

## Database Security

- [ ] Use connection pooling with appropriate limits
- [ ] Implement row-level security (RLS) in Supabase
- [ ] Regularly backup the database
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Dependencies

- [ ] Regularly update dependencies (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Use `npm ci` in CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Audit third-party packages before including them
- [ ] Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities

## Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] Don't log sensitive information
- [ ] Implement proper log rotation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Log security-relevant events

## Deployment

- [ ] Use a secure hosting provider
- [ ] Set up a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Configure proper file permissions
- [ ] Disable directory listing
- [ ] Keep the server and its software updated

## Incident Response

- [ ] Have a plan for security incidents
- [ ] Know how to revoke and rotate credentials
- [ ] Keep contact information updated for security issues

## Regular Security Tasks

- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- [ ] Review user access levels
- [ ] Conduct security audits
- [ ] Test backups regularly

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to [your-email@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).
